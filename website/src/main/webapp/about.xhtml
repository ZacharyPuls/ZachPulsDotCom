            My name is Zach Puls, and I am a software developer at Aero-Mach Labs, Inc.
            I develop in Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using Amazon AWS and Oracle 11g,
            building web applications to both replace legacy systems and implement new ones.
            I have built a badge reader interface that manages all of the door controllers
            at Aero-Mach,and have plans to build a second version using Amazon SQS.

            In my spare time, I work on my home network, building up my server rack and
            setting up all kinds of software to test.
            You can find more information on this in the 'HomeLab' section. I use the
             skills I have learned from labbing to volunteer my time for non-profit organizations.
